Types Of CSS
    inline CSS
     *We can apply CSS in a single element by inline CSS technique.

     *The inline CSS is also a method to insert style sheets in HTML document. 
	 This method mitigates some advantages of style sheets so it is advised to use this method sparingly.

      *If you want to use inline CSS, you should use the style attribute to the relevant tag.

     Syntax:
     <htmltag style="cssproperty1:value; cssproperty2:value;"> </htmltag>   
	 
	 Internal CSS
    *The internal style sheet is used to add a unique style for a single document. 
	*It is defined in <head> section of the HTML page inside the <style> tag.
	
	External CSS
    *The external style sheet is generally used when you want to make changes on multiple pages. It is ideal for this condition because it facilitates you to change the look of the entire web site by changing just one file.
    *It uses the <link> tag on every pages and the <link> tag should be put inside the head section.
	 Example
	 <head>  
     <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css">  
     </head>

  *CSS comments are generally written to explain your code. It is very helpful for the users who reads your code so that they can easily understand the code.
